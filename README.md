## Installation

Simply download the script through [this link](https://github.com/4GlVE/zonetool-helper/releases/latest). Scroll down to `Assets` and download `zonetool-helper.bat`.

Once the script is downloaded, drag and drop into any of your COD4, MW2/IW4x, or MW3 game directories.

**Example directory:**
```text
.../
    └── Steam/
        └── .../
            └── Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
```

Once this is done run the script, then follow the prompts.

## Features

> Downloads Zonetool and its binaries into your game directory, allowing you to choose between Rekti's version or Quak's version.
- **Disclamer:** The download I supplied for Quak's version is believed to be an old build, it has other features that the base version doesn't have, but for most things the base version is good enough.

## To Do List
- [ ] Build Quak's latest as the current download may be an older version.
- [ ] Create a uninstall script within this script.
- [ ] Create an auto-updater for this script.
